        <p class="section__text__p1">Who am I as as person</p> 

        <div class="personal-identity-text-container">
            <p>
                I would describe myself as a technical, creative, and organised person. 
                From early on, I have always been interested in how products function, 
                look, and are produced. The technical side of products like electronics 
                and mechanics made me interested in the design field. I am also interested 
                in peopleâ€™s experiences and interactions while using a product. I also find 
                it essential that the products I develop serve and help people during their 
                work or daily life. The connectedness with people and the solution-orientated 
                design projects I like to work on give me the motivation and energy to continue 
                with what I am doing. For this reason, I try to involve many people during the 
                process to get the most out of the work that I do. 
            <p> 

                <br>

            <p>
                When working on projects, I work best when the environment and the work plan are structured 
                and organized. I find it important that the tasks that I am working on are completely and 
                evenly worked out. I am most satisfied and proud of my work when I look at the end result 
                and know that the process went smoothly and according to plan.
            <p>   
            
                <br>
                
            <p>
                I do not have a strong preference for an individual or group-oriented project because I feel at 
                home in both an individualistic and a group-oriented environment. I can adjust pretty well to my 
                surroundings and work environment. When I work on a group-orientated project, I find it important 
                that everyone is motivated and equally involved, and that the work is evenly distributed. However, 
                when that is not the case, I prefer working individually because then I can make sure that the task 
                and result will be achieved.
            <p>
               
                <br>
                
            <p>
                Although I find the design process very interesting, I must say that the results are just as important 
                to me. This can lead to my approach becoming more practical, efficient and results-oriented. As mentioned 
                earlier, the structure I create for myself ensures that I achieve the results I strive for without compromising 
                the process. 
            <p>
                
                <br>
                
            <p>
                When I work on projects, I always try to apply my (newly gained) knowledge to improve my process and, therefore, 
                my quality of work. I also always aim to understand the design challenge and the problem context as well as possible 
                because I believe they will help me greatly with the process. For that reason, I always try to analyse the context thoroughly. 
                My intrinsic motivation helps me ensure that everything is done as I envisioned towards the end of every project and delivers 
                a great result.

                    <p>
                        As a designer, I aim to design and develop technical products that are useful and meaningful which could help 
                        people with everyday tasks or work. This is not merely by focusing on the product itself but also by integrating 
                        other aspects like stakeholders and user experience during the whole design process.  
                    <p> 

                        <br>

                    <p>
                        What drives me within design is the process of creating something from a simple idea or problem towards a working 
                        prototype as a solution. This is achieved by combining design with technology and the involvement of stakeholders, 
                        research, testing, and prototyping. I aim to create purposeful, valuable, and high-quality products that create an 
                        experience for the end users.  I enjoy converting problems into solutions and then communicating those solutions by 
                        creating visual content, (such as visuals, 3D models, renders, and videos) or physical content like prototypes. 
                        I also think it is important to collaborate with stakeholders to get more out of the process.

                    <p>
                        My interests during the study have grown towards electronic products that are medical or health-related. This is due 
                        to my interest in technical products and my belief that products should be developed for useful applications that serve 
                        and benefit people or our planet. Creating products or doing research for a field which is rapidly involving and innovating, 
                        makes me curious about what I can contribute. This is because I get energy and fulfilment from the work I do when I work with 
                        people, especially people who are grateful, interested, and open-minded to new ideas and products that can help them.
                    <p> 
                        
                        <br>
                    
                    <p>
                        What inspires me as a designer is work from other designers who develop products which have been around for a long time and 
                        that have not changed much due to their brilliant design and function. People who can make high-end functional products without 
                        compromising on aesthetics or looks. Products like this will give the users a pleasant feeling when using and interacting with 
                        them. This will also result in less waste when repairing is more likely than with cheap products which are made to be used less 
                        long or purely for creating revenue.
                    <p> 
                        
                        <br>

                    <p>
                        Because of my creativity and technical background, I think that I am a good all-rounded designer. My strengths therefore I would 
                        say are technical aspects, like electronics, programming, computer-aided design (3D CAD), and prototyping. But also my eye for 
                        detail, intrinsic motivation, and other skills help me to deliver quality work. One of my abilities and qualities I could work on 
                        is, for example, my ability to be more open-minded. With my engineering background, I tend to be slightly more straightforward with 
                        my goals and ideas. In addition, although I like working with other designers, I find it sometimes difficult to give certain tasks 
                        away or let someone else finish or change the work I started with.

                    <h3>My Past</h3>
                    <p>
                        Because of my early interest in the technical field, I first studied <span style="color: rgb(255, 94, 0)">Engineering</span> 
                        in Breda. After graduating, I concluded that I enjoyed working on technical products and systems but that I missed the creative 
                        part during the process and the interaction between the users and the products that I was developing.  

                        Therefore, I started the <span style="color: rgb(46, 150, 80)">bachelor of Industrial Product Design</span> at the 
                        Hogeschool Rotterdam. Throughout this study, I realised that developing user-oriented products was far more interesting 
                        and valuable to me. After graduating from the bachelor program, I decided to start with the pre-master program of Industrial 
                        Design at the Eindhoven University of Technology to gain more knowledge within the work field and on certain topics like user 
                        experience and innovating novel technologies. 
                        
                        When I completed the pre-master, I continued with the <span style="color: rgb(0, 195, 255)">master of Industrial Design</span>. 
                        This allowed me to further specialise in academic subjects that interested me and that were related to product development. 
                        The master also greatly helped me to develop myself on a professional level and with scoping my vision.

                        <h3>My Present</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am currently graduating from the Master of Industrial Design at the Eindhoven University of Technology. During my master I chose 
                        the Master Track: Research, Design, and Development because it fits my personal and professional identity the best. By choosing this 
                        track and following specific offered courses during the master, I believe I can achieve the goals I have set in my vision and future 
                        plans. Through my different previous educations, I have developed many different skills that I can use and that have made me the 
                        Industrial Designer I am today.

                        <h3>My Future</h3>
                    <p>
                        During this master, I concluded that I want to continue working and designing for medical environments with the development of technical, 
                        electronic and innovative equipment. It fits my vision and areas of expertise best and I feel that I get the most satisfaction from working 
                        in that environment. I see myself working in a medium to large company (design agency) where people from multiple disciplines work together. 
                        I have previous experience working in a small (5-8 people) medical company as part of a design team of two. However, I feel that I have more 
                        to offer and learn in a larger design team.

                    <p>
                        Over the next five to ten years, <span style="color: rgb(255, 94, 0)">technology will be integrated into our daily lives more than ever</span>.
                        If we look at AI, for example, it is expected that AI will show a (market) growth of around 30% by 2030 
                        (Statista, 2024). This means that we as designers are more concerned than ever with technology-oriented 
                        products. We strive to make our lives as efficient and comfortable as possible. However, when we look at 
                        healthcare, for example, the workload for healthcare professionals continues to increase and it becomes 
                        more difficult to find new people. In low-income countries, a shortage of 10 million health workers is 
                        expected by 2030 (World Health Organization: WHO, 2019). In a field that needs more assistance, with an 
                        expected growth of 15.7% worldwide (Statista, 2024), we as designers could make a difference by innovating 
                        and developing new products to serve and help every stakeholder involved. We could help people prepare for 
                        the coming market growth and make sure that everyone can get the help that they may need in the future.

                        human factor and experience when looking for new solutions and creating new products. The <span style="color: rgb(255, 94, 0)">products must remain user-oriented</span>, 
                        even if they work faster, are smarter, or take over certain tasks.

                    <h3>My Goal</h3>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to <span style="color: rgb(255, 94, 0)">design and develop useful and meaningful products</span> that solve real and specific problems for people 
                        and together with people. To achieve this result, I took courses and electives that focused on users and society, 
                        more specifically on topics such as interaction, experience and medical healthcare. During my studies, I also took 
                        more technical-focused subjects such as interfaces, data, and electronics, because of my interest in technology and 
                        the realisation of products. This combination of acquired knowledge has helped me to achieve my current goals and 
                        will prepare me for my future goals.

                    <h3>Chosen Areas of Expertise</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my master Industrial Design, I decided to focus on <span style="color: rgb(255, 94, 0)">Technology & Realisation</span> 
                        and <span style="color: rgb(255, 94, 0)">User & Society</span> as my two main areas of expertise. I have chosen Technology & Realisation 
                        because of my interest in technical products and my previous education. I choose User & Society because I value useful products that have a 
                        positive impact on all stakeholders involved. Currently, I am interested in health-related projects and products, therefore I think that choosing 
                        Technology & Realisation and User & Society as areas of expertise is a strong combination and will work well together for my professional development 
                        as a designer. In addition, the <span style="color: rgb(255, 94, 0)">Design & Research Processes</span> competence is shown due to it being the 
                        fundamental of the master Industrial Design. I also additionally highlighted <span style="color: rgb(255, 94, 0)">Creativity & Aesthetics</span> 
                        because that was a previous choice which I developed before changing it to User & Society.

            <h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 162, 255)">Business and Entrepreneurship</span></h3>
            <p>
                This expertise area is mostly about the business side of design. While I didnâ€™t specifically follow any courses focused on 
                this expertise area, I did integrate this area in multiple projects, such as my FMP, by including various stakeholders during 
                the process and analysing the productâ€™s feasibility, viability, and desirability through value propositions and looking at the 
                productâ€™s position and potential. 
            </p>

            <br> 

            <h3><span style="color: rgb(209, 0, 0)">Creativity and Aesthetics</span></h3>
            <p>
                I argue that this expertise area is mandatory to develop during an education as a designer. During this master, I followed courses 
                about this subject, focussing on transforming thinking patterns and interaction with materials. For me, creativity is about creating 
                the right solution for a given problem using the right approach, as I did during my FMP. Aesthetics for me, is focussing on the 
                perception and interaction between the user and the product. My M1.1 Design Project: Quetta and Course Elective: Paradox are good 
                examples of how to integrate this area within a design challenge.

            <h3><span style="color: rgb(143, 0, 209)">Math, Data and Computing</span></h3>
            <p>
                During this master, I took courses on topics, such as data structures, algorithms (AI), and data-enabled design to enhance my skills 
                regarding using and analysing collected data. I deployed these skills, especially during my M1.2 Research Project: Vein Finding by 
                collecting and analysing quantitative and qualitative data. But also during my FMP through analysing sensory data. 
            </p>

            <h3><span style="color: rgb(245, 180, 0)">Technology and Realisation</span></h3>
            <p>
                During this master, I further developed myself on a technical level by following courses about new and innovative technologies. 
                I did this to broaden my existing skills and to become more familiar with other types of technology. This is to get more out of 
                the products that I develop and to improve my prototyping skills. I demonstrated this in almost all my projects during my master 
                (M1.1, M1.2, and FMP), by making high-fidelity interactive prototypes which illustrated the desired features and functions to its users.
            </p>

            <br> 

            <h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 160, 0)">User and Society</span></h3>
            <p>
                The user and society are, in general, a large part of my aim regarding professional identity and vision. Therefore, I took a few courses 
                about user experience in theory, practice, and design. This was to develop my overall skills in understanding involved stakeholders better 
                during the design process and aspects like interaction with a product or system. I also took a specific course about researching the future 
                of products, users, and society which helped me shape and adjust my vision. All these courses highly influenced my perspective on designing 
                for users and society. As a result, I involved multiple stakeholders and performed multiple evaluations during the design process of my final master project.
            </p>

            <br> 

            <h3><span style="color: rgb(34, 186, 247)">Design & Research Processes</span></h3>
            <p>
                My master graduation project was, in my opinion, an ideal example of a design and research process. This is because the chosen design approach 
                (double diamond) and methods were a good fit with the overall design challenge and my chosen master track (RDD). This allowed me to showcase all 
                the knowledge gained during the master. The FMP included extensive necessary research at the beginning to get a clear picture of the problem and 
                context. The second part showed the iterative process of the design and development of the product. This all resulted in a solution, which showed 
                great potential for all stakeholders involved.
